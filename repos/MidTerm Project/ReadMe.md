# Background

Asheville NC is a beautiful wooded region in North Carolina which borders Tennessee. It is known for it's attractive landscapes, laid back vibe, and as a launching pad for the myriad of tourist attractions in the region. In 2021, Asheville was ranked among the top location to visit in North Carolina based on TripAdvisor recommendations. With this high number of visitors, Asheville rental properties are in demand for short term rental stays, limiting the number of long-term rentals which are available for residential/family rentals. In an attempt to curb  a housing shortage for residents, the city of Asheville banned whole-house short term rentals in 2018. However, as of October 2021, AirBnB, a web-based provider for short-term rentals has over 2500 listings for Asheville, NC.

# Data Overview
Airbnb launched an API in 2017, but as of 2021, is no longer allowing access to their internal data. As a result, individuals and groups have resorted to webscraping Airbnb. Among them, InsideAirbnb is an organization who has created an activiist project aimed at revealing Airbnb data to the public. For this study, I used InsideAirBnb data (found here) collected between 18 OCT -19 OCT 2021 where the home was listed with Asheville city limits. The following statistics were found:

*     2563 house listings available to rent
*     1642 unique hosts offering rentals
